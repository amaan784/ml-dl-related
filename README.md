# Hugging Face

## Pipeline Function-

The pipeline function returns an end to end object that performs an NLP task on one or more several texts.

works in 3 steps -
1) pre-processing the text(s) -  applies tokenizer to the model
2) feeds the pre processed text to the model 
3) post processing - shows results

workflow-

--> pre-process --> Model --> post process-->

The Pipeline API supports most common NLP tasks-
- Text Classification
- Zero Shot Classification
- Text Generation
- Text Completion (mask filling)
- Token Classification
- Question Answering
- Summarization
- Translation
